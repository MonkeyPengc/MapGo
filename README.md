# MapGo
A web app built on the google app engine.

web url: http://maptrack-1283.appspot.com/

### Project Details

This app needs the user to register an account before using it.

The current content includes tracking the path, and showing the corresponding satellite map, of your upload file.

I paste a file here(gps.txt), where data are recorded by a RC Drone, so that you got the idea.


### Running on local host, or Uploading to GAE

Please reference:
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ 

More functions will be introduced later, in order to be more useful and robust.

##### User Interaction
- map type
- zoom
- add path
